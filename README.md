I specialize in dissecting intricate datasets and delivering actionable data-driven recommendations. My expertise spans various programming languages, data analysis and visualization tools, and statistical techniques. I am dedicated to continuous professional development, having completed multiple technical projects and engaged in over 40 hours of internal workshops to enhance my skills.

Currently, I am working with sales data to investigate the high number of returned orders at the Superstore by using Tableau. The primary goal was to understand the root causes of customer returns and identify strategies to reduce the volume of returned orders. My previous experience in AIQUEST INTELLIGENCE helped me develop my communication, analytical, time-management, and problem-solving skills. In 2023, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program. The curriculum covered Python(Pandas, Numpy, Beautiful Soup, Matplotlib), Data visualization( Tableau, Powerbi), SQL, Excel, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects</p>
